Trading Days Calculator in Python 3.7.4

This will create a calculator for how many trading days there are in a month up as well as what trading day you are currently on. This is factored for the bond trading calendar, just make changes to the custom Calendar in order to adjust for whatever holiday schedule your office uses. Helped with code I found on github, but refactored for this specific use. 


HOW TO USE:
Just run python3 tradingDaysCalculator.py from command line.
Will print out the information you want.
